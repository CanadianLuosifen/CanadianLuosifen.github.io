## Introduction
Hi there! I am Fangchen Wang, an aspiring full stack developer currently taking an Advanced Diploma in Software Development at Mohawk College.
I enjoy solving problems and sharing them, with an interest towards my gaming hobby, but always willing to try new things. I also have over 
16 years of experience as a Recreation Aide in a long-term care setting, so if you have a digital problem in this field I would be happy to build a solution for it!
